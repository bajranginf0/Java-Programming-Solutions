Find first non-repeating element in a given Array of integers
Given an array of integers of size N, the task is to find the first non-repeating element in this array. 

Examples:

Input: {-1, 2, -1, 3, 0}
Output: 2
Explanation: The first number that does not repeat is : 2

Input: {9, 4, 9, 6, 7, 4}
Output: 6

Given an array having positive and negative numbers, our task is to arrange them in an alternate fashion such that every positive number is followed by a negative number and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance. The number of positive and negative numbers need not to be equal. If there are more positive numbers then they have to appear at the end of the array , same condition for negative numbers also .

Examples: 

Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4}
Output: arr[] = {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}

Input:  arr[] = {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8}
Output: arr[] = {-5, 5, -2, 2, -8, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0}

Shuffle the Array:

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]

Number of Employees Who Met the Target:

There are n employees in a company, numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee i has worked for hours[i] hours in the company.

The company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.

You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers hours of length n and a non-negative integer target.

Return the integer denoting the number of employees who worked at least target hours.

 

Example 1:

Input: hours = [0,1,2,3,4], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 2 hours.
- Employee 0 worked for 0 hours and didn't meet the target.
- Employee 1 worked for 1 hours and didn't meet the target.
- Employee 2 worked for 2 hours and met the target.
- Employee 3 worked for 3 hours and met the target.
- Employee 4 worked for 4 hours and met the target.
There are 3 employees who met the target.
Example 2:

Input: hours = [5,1,4,2,2], target = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 6 hours.
There are 0 employees who met the target.

Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies:

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

 

Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
